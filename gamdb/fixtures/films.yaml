Robert Anthony De Niro, Jr. was born on August 17, 1943 in New York's Manhattan borough to artists Robert De Niro, Sr., and Virginia Admiral, who divorced when their son was two years of age. He developed an interest in performing through visits to local movie houses with his father, and soon began acting in school productions while also receiving his earliest training at Maria Picator's Dramatic Workshop, where his mother worked as a typist and copyeditor. De Niro briefly attended the High School of Music and Art but left in the ninth grade, citing a high level of competition and his own shyness. But after a cross-country trip to visit relatives in 1960, the 16-year-old De Niro decided to leave high school altogether and enroll at the Stella Adler Conservatory. After additional training with Lee Strasberg at the Actor's Studio, he began auditioning for film roles. Though he would make his screen acting debut in Brian De Palma's low-budget comedy \"The Wedding Party,\" the film would not be released until 1969, so his uncredited turn the French comedy \"Three Rooms in Manhattan\" (1965) would mark his actual film debut. Three years later, he reunited with De Palma for the bawdy freeform comedy \"Greetings\" (1968), which earned a Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. He bounced between arthouse and drive-in fare for his next few projects, teaming again with De Palma for \"Hi, Mom!\" (1970), a comedy about amateur pornographers, and playing a drug-addicted Depression Era gangster in Roger Corman's \"Bloody Mama\" (1970) before earning critical praise as a terminally ill baseball player in \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" (1973). That same year, he also starred as a dangerously off-kilter hood in \"Mean Streets\" (1973), which marked the beginning of his long and celebrated collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. The film would serve as a launching pad for a remarkable string of projects in the 1970s, beginning in 1974 with \"The Godfather Part II,\" which earned him an Oscar for his performance - entirely in Sicilian - as the young Vito Corleone. Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), which brought a second Oscar nomination for his turn as a psychotic who believed himself to be a criminal avenger, and Bernardo Bertolucci's \"1900\" (1976) soon followed, as did his thinly veiled portrait of studio head Irving Thalberg in Elia Kazan's \"The Last Tycoon\" (1976) and a third Oscar nod for Michael Cimino's harrowing Vietnam War drama \"The Deer Hunter\" (1979). After teaming with Scorsese for the period drama \"New York, New York\" (1977), the duo reunited again for \"Raging Bull\" (1980), a elegiac portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta; De Niro, who gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in his twilight years, earned a second Oscar for his intensely committed and rigorously physical performance. The dawn of the 1980s saw De Niro working with some of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the world, including the scabrous \"King of Comedy\" (1982) with Scorsese, the epic gangster film \"Once Upon a Time in America\" for Sergio Leone, the fantasy \"Brazil\" (1984) for Terry Gilliam, and the sweeping period drama \"The Mission\" (1985) for Roland Joffe. He then reunited with De Palma to play a malevolent Al Capone in the director's big-screen take of \"The Untouchables\" (1987) before dipping into mainstream waters as a foul-mouthed skip tracer in Martin Brest's popular action-comedy \"Midnight Run\" (1988). In the '90s, De Niro settled into a breathless schedule of acting roles in both studio and arthouse features. The most notable of these was his turn as an Irish mobster in an Italian crime family in Scorsese's celebrated \"Goodfellas\" (1990), as well as back-to-back Oscar nominations for Penny Marshall's \"Awakenings\" (1991), which cast him as a comatose patient revived by Dr. Oliver Sacks' experimental therapy, and Scorsese's remake of \"Cape Fear\" (1992), with De Niro as a feral criminal pursuing lawyer Nick Nolte's family. Between these efforts were collaborations with Martin Ritt and Jane Fonda in \"Stanley & Iris\" (1990), Ron Howard on the firefighter drama \"Backdraft\" (1991), Bill Murray in John McNaughton's \"Mad Dog and Glory\" (1993), and Kenneth Branagh, who cast him as the Monster in \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" (1994). De Niro also found time during this period to make his directorial debut with \"A Bronx Tale\" (1993), a sentimental period piece based on co-star Chazz Palminteri's nostalgic one-man show, and a reunion with Scorsese and frequent co-star Joe Pesci for \"Casino\" (1995), a story of organized crime in Las Vegas. He would cap the decade with several high-quality projects, including a supporting turn for Quentin Tarantino in \"Jackie Brown\" (1997) and a lead in two superlative caper films, John Frankenheimer's \"Ronin\" (1998) and Michael Mann's \"Heat\" (1995). But with the turn of the new millennium, De Niro's screen output appeared to take a decidedly downward turn. Critics and fans of his early work were dismayed to see appear in lackluster comedies like \"Showtime\" (2002) with Eddie Murphy and wan thrillers like \"Godsend\" (2004) and \"Righteous Kill\" (2008) with Al Pacino, and bemoaned the broad comedy \"Meet the Parents\" (2000), which cast him as a spymaster and strict father determined to undermine new son-in-law Ben Stiller, and its sequels \"Meet the Fockers\" (2004) and \"Little Fockers\" (2010). In truth, De Niro's prodigious output during this period also included a number of well-received and popular films, including the thriller \"City by the Sea\" (2002) and a second directorial effort with the espionage drama \"The Good Shepherd\" (2006), as a producer, oversaw the \"Fockers\" films, \"About a Boy\" (2002) and \"Rent\" (2005) through his TriBeCa Productions. But the sheer number of forgettable films in his c.v. during the 2000s undermined - at least in the eyes of some fans and reviewers - his more celebrated titles. For this demographic, De Niro rebounded with solid character turns in three films for David O. Russell: the quirky \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012), which earned him a fifth Oscar nomination, his '70s New York drama \"American Hustle\" (2013) and the rags-to-riches comedy \"Joy\" (2015). After a spate of largely unremarkable features, De Niro capped 2019 with major roles in two high-profile features: the Cannes hit \"Joker\" (2019), with Joaquin Phoenix as the DC villain and De Niro as a merciless talk show host, and \"The Irishman\" (2019), a reunion with Scorsese, Pacino and Pesci based on the real-life story of Frank Sheeran, who was allegedly responsible for the disappearance of labor chief Jimmy Hoffa."}}, {"model": "films.actor", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Morgan Freeman", "birth_year": 1937, "slug": "morgan-freeman", "photo_url": "https://i.idnes.cz/08/081/maxi/JAZ24dd72_morganfreeman_WEN_80448506.jpg", "description": "Born in Tennessee in 1937, Morgan Freeman moved often throughout his childhood, living in Mississippi and Indiana before eventually settling in Chicago, Illinois. He began performing in school plays at age nine and by 12, he was performing on a Nashville based radio show. After graduating high school, Freeman served for four years in the United States Air Force and was honorably discharged with the rank of Airman 1st Class. He decided to return to his interest in performing at this point, moving to Los Angeles where he could study acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. His early breaks included a role in a touring production of \"The Royal Sea Hunt\" and a handful of appearances as an extra in films like \"The Pawnbroker\" (1964) and \"A Man Called Adam\" (1966) before he finally began booking on-screen speaking roles, appearing in the TV movie \"Caught in the Middle\" (1970) and soon joining the cast of the progressive kids program \"The Electric Company\" (PBS, 1971-77) in 1971. The actor's credits became steadily more prominent after that series wrapped in 1977, with him appearing with Robert Redford in the prison drama \"Brubaker\" (1980) and with Nick Nolte in the comedy-drama \"Teachers\" (1984). Freeman made waves in 1987 when he played a fast talking pimp in the drama \"Street Smart\" (1987), earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The role put him on Hollywood's radar. In 1989 alone, he played Sergeant Major John Rawlins in the Civil War drama \"Glory\" (1989), a highly unconventional principal at a disadvantaged school in the drama \"Lean on Me\" (1989), and a chauffeur who strikes up an unexpected friendship with an elderly woman in \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989), for which he earned his second Academy Award nomination. He followed this banner year with roles in the blockbuster \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991) and the gritty Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992) before earning a third Oscar nod, this time for his role as the second lead as well as the narrator in the inspiring drama \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994). In 1995, Freeman co-starred with Brad Pitt as a detective investigating a serial killer in the acclaimed crime drama \"Se7en\" (1995). He went on to play the president of the United States in \"Deep Impact\" (1998) and God himself in the comedy \"Bruce Almighty\" (2003), before finally winning an Oscar for his role as a boxing coach in the Clint Eastwood directed drama \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). Freeman continued to appear in several projects per year for the next several years, memorably reprising the role of God in \"Evan Almighty\" (2007), as well as appearing in \"Gone Baby Gone\" (2007), \"Wanted\" (2008), the blockbuster \"Dark Knight\" (2008) franchise, and the true life soccer drama \"Invictus\" (2009)-for which he earned yet another Oscar nod. Freeman played the president once again in the action movie \"Olympus Has Fallen\" (2013) and made an unexpected but memorable appearance as Ilderim in the big-budget remake of \"Ben-Hur\" (2016). While also appearing in films like \"Just Getting Started\" (2017) and \"The Poison Rose\" (2019), Freeman also reprised his role as President Trumbull for the \"Olympus Has Fallen\" sequels \"London Has Fallen\" (2016) and \"Angel Has Fallen\" (2019)."}}, {"model": "films.actor", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Christoph Waltz", "birth_year": 1956, "slug": "chris-waltz", "photo_url": "https://www.watchuseek.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,width=1920,height=1920,fit=scale-down/https://www.watchuseek.com/attachments/img_20210201_144743-jpg.15684175/", "description": "A true late bloomer in Hollywood, Christoph Waltz was one of many actors whose genius was overlooked for decades until someone was willing to take a chance on his talent.

His layered performance as the multi-lingual, deceptively suave, cold-blooded \"Jew Hunter\" earned Waltz a coveted Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Suddenly, the Austrian actor was an international star, working with directors like Michel Gondry in the superhero romp \"The Green Hornet\" (2011) and Roman Polanski in the dark comedy-drama \"Carnage\" (2011) before rejoining Tarantino and winning a second Academy Award for his role of a bounty hunter in \"Django Unchained.\" Roles as varied as notorious art-world fraud Walter Keane in Tim Burton's \"Big Eyes\" (2014) and iconic Bond villain Blofeld in \"Spectre\" (2015) followed.

A mere two years later, he was the toast of the independent circuit with his brave performance in Danny Boyle's highly regarded \"Trainspotting\" (1996), which propelled the young actor to stardom virtually overnight. Ever since his acclaimed portrait of a heroin addict struggling to put his drug days behind him, McGregor was a consistent presence in features like \"Emma\" (1996) and \"A Life Less Ordinary\" (1997) as well as blockbusters like smash musical, \"Moulin Rouge\" (2001). Never shy to speak his mind, he routinely lambasted big budget Hollywood movies, only to find himself playing one of the most beloved characters in one of the most popular film franchise of all time. As Obi-Wan Kenobi in the three \"Star Wars\" prequels - \"The Phantom Menace\" (1999), \"Attack of the Clones\" (2002) and \"Revenge of the Sith\" (2005) - McGregor deftly channeled the character created by Sir Alec Guinness, while at the same time making it his own.

Born in Los Angeles, California in 1974, DiCaprio began acting as a small child, appearing in commercials. His first major TV role came in 1990 when he joined the cast of the sitcom \"Growing Pains\" (ABC, 1985-1992) as Luke, a homeless boy taken in by the Seaver family. The young actor's star power was immediately evident, and it was not long before Robert De Niro handpicked DiCaprio to co-star with him in the feature film \"This Boy's Life\" (1993). DiCaprio earned strong reviews for his performance, and he won even more acclaim for his portrayal of a young man living with a mental disability in \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\" (1993) that same year. DiCaprio's simultaneous status as both a prodigious actor and teen heartthrob climbed higher as he co-starred with Claire Danes in Baz Lurman's unusual adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Romeo + Juliet\" (1996), but it inarguably reached a zenith when he paired with Kate Winslet for the romantic blockbuster \"Titanic\" (1997) the following year. Now commanding the ability to work on virtually any project he wished, DiCaprio took the opportunity to make some smaller, more artistically minded films including Woody Allen's \"Celebrity\" (1998), and to begin using his fame and wealth to further environmental causes-a passion that would prove nearly equal to his drive as an actor. However, when it came time to choose his next major, big-budget project, DiCaprio's choice proved to be pivotal, as he teamed with famed director Martin Scorsese for the first time on the period drama \"Gangs of New York\" (2002). He also starred in Ron Howard's hit biopic of young con man Frank Abignale Jr. in \"Catch Me if You Can\" (2002) that same year, but DiCaprio's creative partnership with Scorsese would remain a vital force in his career for years to come. They worked together two years later on \"The Aviator\" (2004), which found DiCaprio portraying famed tycoon Howard Hughes, and again the following year on the highly acclaimed crime drama \"The Departed\" (2005). Just over a decade after \"Titanic\" and its epic success, DiCaprio joined co-star Kate Winslet again for a near thematic inversion of their previous film in the tortured marriage drama \"Revolutionary Road\" (2008). Quickly thereafter, DiCaprio returned to his partnership with Scorsese for the Hitchcock-esque \"Shutter Island\" (2010). His next major project was Christopher Nolan's hit mind-bending drama \"Inception\" (2010). Then in 2012, a last-minute conflict with another actor left an unexpected opening in Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" (2012). This happy accident led to DiCaprio portraying the villainous Calvin Candie in the film-a happenstance that would later prove fortuitous for both actor and director. However, DiCaprio first reteamed with Baz Lurman for the title role in the glittery \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013) and with Scorsese for the criminal biopic \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013), not to mention win worldwide acclaim for his role in the wilderness survival film \"The Revenant\" (2015), before his small but memorable appearance in \"Django Unchained\" bore dividends. This moment finally came in 2019, when Tarantino asked DiCaprio to star in his film about the '60s film industry and the infamous Manson murders, \"Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood\" (2019). Co-starring with Brad Pitt as a washed-up actor and his charming stuntman respectively, both the film and DiCaprio's performance in it proved to be a major cultural sensation."}}, {"model": "films.actor", "pk": 6, "fields": {"name": "Tom Hanks", "birth_year": 1956, "slug": "tom-hanks", "photo_url": "https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/62982_v9_bb.jpg", "description": "With an on-screen persona so likeable that he was often referred to as \"America's Dad,\" Tom Hanks cemented a reputation as one of the most respected actors of his generation. Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks participated in school plays, discovering that acting was a good outlet for his energy and wit. He went on to study theater at California State University, Sacramento and as a three-year intern at Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. He finally moved to New York in 1979 and made his film debut in the low budget horror movie \"He Knows You're Alone\" (1979). The following year, Hanks landed his first big break, co-starring in the sitcom \"Bosom Buddies\" (ABC, 1980-82) with Peter Scolari. He starred in the hit fantasy-comedy \"Splash\" (1984) with Daryl Hannah two years later, which he quickly followed with the zany comedy \"Bachelor Party\" (1984). Hanks' feature film career was off and running, and he continued his hot streak with the comedies \"The Man with One Red Shoe\" (1985) and \"The Money Pit\" (1985). Though he experienced some turbulence in his personal life when he and wife Samantha Lewes were divorced in 1987, his next professional triumph remained just around the corner, as he was soon starring as a 13 year old boy trapped in a 32 year old man's body in Penny Marshall's smash hit \"Big\" (1988). Hanks remarried actor Rita Wilson that same year, and embarked on a string of cult hits like \"The 'Burbs'\" (1989) and \"Joe Versus the Volcano\" (1990). By 1992, he was well established as star and ready for the next phase in his career, and he impressed both audiences and critics with an unexpected performance as a washed up baseball player turned coach in the acclaimed World War II era sports film \"A League of Their Own\" (1992). Hanks quickly followed this with a turn as a widowed father looking for love opposite Meg Ryan in the massively popular \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993). He followed this with two back-to-back award-winning performances, one as a gay man suffering from both AIDS and discrimination in \"Philadelphia\" (1993), and another as an intellectually limited man who plays a pivotal role in history in Ron Howard's \"Forrest Gump\" (1994). Hanks would reteam with Howard the following year to portray astronaut Jim Lovell in \"Apollo 13\" (1995), the same year he began voice acting the role of cowboy doll Woody in the cutting-edge CG family film \"Toy Story\" (1995). Ready to expand his horizons further, Hanks next opted to direct his first feature, the period movie \"That Thing You Do!\" (1996), in which he also played a supporting role. Hanks rounded out the '90s with a turn in the acclaimed war film \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) before reteaming with Meg Ryan for another romance, \"You've Got Mail\" (1998). Hanks reprised the role of Woody for \"Toy Story 2\" (1999) before wowing audiences with his performance as a man battling for survival against both loneliness and the elements in \"Cast Away\" (2000).
